Short description.

AI::ParticleSwarmOptimization implements the Particle Swarm Optimization technique for finding
the minimum point of a hyper surface.

Long description

The module provides an OO interface to a PSO engine that is highly configurable
and may be further altered through derivation.

The module is easy to use despite a moderately large number of configuration
options through provision of good defaults for most configuration parameters.
